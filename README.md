# Percolation

This is the first assignment from Princeton's Algorithms course that can be found on www.coursera.org. The text of the assignment can be found as an html file in the Percolation/assignment folder. The visualizers are given from the course, you can use the Interactive one or the non-interactive one to test out the legitimacy of the algorithms that i created for solving the percolation problem.

The different test cases are found in the inner percolation folder, and a different test case can be selected by changing the input source in the main method of the visualizer classes.
